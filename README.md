Project Descriptions

Task 1:

Titanic Classification

In this Dataset I have Find The survival count of people. I have Builded a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques
in Python.


Task 2:

SMS Classification

In this Dataset I classified whether the sms received are spam or non-spam and what is count of it by Data cleaning, Data preprocessing and using Machine Learning algorithms. In this I Developded a text classification model to classify SMS using various data science techniques.


Task 3: 

Dogs and cats image classification 

In this Dataset I developed a model which will distinguish between dogs and cats images. If you add more images in directory it will work accordingly. This is my first CNN model.
